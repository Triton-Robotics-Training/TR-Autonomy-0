Congratulations and welcome to the Autonomy team! Before we can jump into coding, we need to setup our environment first.
To run our code in TR, you need at least 2 things: **Ubuntu** and **ROS2**
- **Ubuntu** is a Distro that runs on Linux, which is a type of Operating System.
- **ROS2** (Robot Operating System) is a combination of software libraries to develop robotics projects, best run on ubuntu.

We recommend setting up Ubuntu either by simulating it through a Virtual Machine (non optimal since it's slow), or through Dual Boot 

### Make sure to install these versions: Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble

## Installing Ubuntu

### Dual Boot (for x86 only):
Here's a pretty good guide on installing Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview

### Virtual Machine (Survivable):
#### For x86:
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

[VMWare Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)
#### For M1:
[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)

Example of a running version of Ubuntu

## Installing ROS2
Once you have a running Ubuntu install, follow these directions to install ROS2 Humble (I recommend the Desktop Install): https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debians.html  

Make sure to install using the debian packages, __not from source__!

If you can get a publisher and a talker running in terminal, congratulations! You've just setup your environment. Just make sure to take a screenshot of ubuntu and commit it to your work of this repository. Before you move on to week 1, we now recommend:
- brushing up on C++ ([link](https://www.learncpp.com/))
- reading the ROS2 humble [documentation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials.html)  
More resources can be accessed by clicking the "CV Training Resources badge" at the top of the README to see the relevant chapters.

**To complete this assignment, take a screenshot of ubuntu running, add it to this git repo, and commit+push it.**

To run our code in TR, you need at least 2 things: **Ubuntu** and **ROS2**

You can dual boot Ubuntu on your computer's hard drive, create a bootable external drive, or (not recommended) use something like VMWare player.

### Make sure to install these versions: Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS2 Humble

## Native (x86 only):

Here's a pretty good guide on installing Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview

## Virtual Machine (Also good):
### For x86:
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

[VMWare Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)
### For M1:
[UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/)

Once you have a running Ubuntu install, you need to install ROS2 Humble: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

Finally, before attempting unit 1, you should brush up on C++ and read through the ROS2 Humble docs. Click the "CV Training Resources" badge above to see the relevant chapters.

If you want to try running some of the tutorial code in C++ or Python, feel free. But we use C++ on the robots.

**To complete this assignment, take a screenshot of ubuntu running, add it to this git repo, and commit+push it.**

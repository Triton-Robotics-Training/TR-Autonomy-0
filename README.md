To run our code in TR, you need at least 2 things: Ubuntu and ROS2

You can dual boot Ubuntu on your computer's hard drive, create a bootable external drive, or (not recommended) use something like VMWare player.

**Make sure to install Ubuntu 22.04 for ROS2 Humble**

Here's a pretty good guide on installing Ubuntu: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop#1-overview

Once you have a running Ubuntu install, you need to install ROS2 Humble: https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation.html

And you should install miniconda: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#linux-installers

To learn more about conda, read [this getting started guide](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html).

Finally, before attempting unit 1, you should brush up on C++. Chapters 1-11 of https://www.learncpp.com/, as well as the smart pointers sections in M.6 & M.7, are useful.

You should also read through the [ROS2 Humble docs](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble), specifically [**Concepts > Basic Concepts**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Concepts/Basic.html), [**Tutorials > Beginner CLI Tools**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-CLI-Tools.html), and [**Tutorials > Beginner Client Libraries**](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Tutorials/Beginner-Client-Libraries.html).

If you want to try running some of the tutorial code in C++ or Python, feel free. But we use C++ on the robots.

**To complete this assignment, take a screenshot of ubuntu running, add it to this git repo, and commit+push it.**
